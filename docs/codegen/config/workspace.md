# Workspace Configuration

`jtd-codebuild` supports multiple projects in a workspace. You can define a workspace configuration file `jtd-codebuild-workspace.json` to manage multiple projects in a workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> The file name should be `jtd-codebuild-workspace.json`. No other file name is allowed.

## Configuration Options

Currently, no configuration options are available for workspace configuration, and the only purpose of the `jtd-codebuild-workspace.json` file is to find where the workspace root is.
